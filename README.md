History
JavaScript was developed by Brendan Eich in 1995, which appeared in Netscape, a popular browser of that time.

The language was initially called LiveScript and was later renamed JavaScript. There are many programmers who think that JavaScript and Java are the same. In fact, JavaScript and Java are very much unrelated. Java is a very complex programming language whereas JavaScript is only a scripting language. The syntax of JavaScript is mostly influenced by the programming language C.
